# Purpose
Interactive dashboard to explore belly button microbe diversity within human navels.  The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (operational taxonomic units (OTUs)) appeared in > 70% of people tested, while the other OTUs were fairly rare.  The dashboard provides the ability to select a sample to update the bar chart (top 10), spedometer (scrubs per week) and the scatter plot (OTU Id vs sample values) to examine each sample independently.  Finally, a demographics table is updated and a static scatter plot appears at the bottom showing scrubs per week by age.
